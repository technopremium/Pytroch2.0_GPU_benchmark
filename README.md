# This is a benchmark to test GPU performance: training time, train samples per second and Accuracy using Pytorch2.0.

# Clone the ripo and start the enviorment
conda env create -f pytorch2.0_environment.yml
conda activate pytorch2.0

# Run jupyter lab to make things easier 
jupyter lab 

# Once inside the lab open the trainier.ipynb and start running cell by cell
